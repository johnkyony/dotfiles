= My Rails application generator

== Features

I am using a Rails application generator 
so I can hit the ground running when I start a new Rails project.

My template generates an app with these libraries all ready to go:

- Core Stack
* Rails 4.1
* PostgreSQL
* Slim
* Sass
* Bootstrap
* Simple Form

- Testing
* minitest 
* Capybara
//* Poltergeist

- Development
* Guard for minitest, livereload, bundlet
//* Foreman, Simplecov, Cane, Awesome Print, Mailcatcher
